The functions sidebar is divided into areas. The upper area shows C functions that appear in the C files and C functions that are logged from inside the TeSSLa files of the current project. Each C file that can be found recursively in the current project directory is considered when fetching function names. On the other hand only the first found TeSSLa is used by the IDE.
